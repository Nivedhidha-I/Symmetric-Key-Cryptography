# Cryptography Demonstrator: Algorithms and Principles

## Project Summary

This repository contains a Python-based web application built using Streamlit that provides live demonstrations and the underlying code for several foundational classical cryptographic algorithms. The project serves as an interactive educational tool to explore symmetric encryption, substitution, and transposition ciphers, reinforcing core concepts in applied cryptography.

## Security & Academic Value  

This project highlights a solid understanding of fundamental information security principles:

* Symmetric Encryption Mastery: Demonstrates the ability to implement, encrypt, and decrypt data using various symmetric key techniques.

* Cipher Analysis: Provides practical insight into the mechanisms, limitations (e.g., fixed key space, frequency analysis vulnerabilities), and historical context of classical ciphers.

* Algorithmic Thinking: Showcases proficiency in translating complex cryptographic rules into working, well-structured Python code.

## Technical Scope & Algorithms  

The application is built entirely in Python and utilizes NumPy for array manipulation required by block and polyalphabetic ciphers.

* Substitution Ciphers: Caesar Cipher, Shift Cipher, Substitution Cipher, One-Time Pad (OTP).

* Polyalphabetic Ciphers: Vigenere Cipher.

* Transposition Ciphers: Rail Fence Cipher, Permutation Cipher.

* Block Ciphers: Playfair Cipher (implemented using a 5x5 key matrix).

* Technology Stack: Python, Streamlit (Web Interface), NumPy (Data manipulation).

## Key Professional Learnings (The Conclusion)

* Applied Cryptography: Practical experience in implementing foundational encryption algorithms from scratch.

* Interactive Tool Development: Proficiency in building user-friendly, interactive web applications using the Streamlit framework to showcase technical concepts.

* Code Modularization: Demonstrated ability to structure complex logic (cipher functions) clearly and integrate them into a cohesive application interface.
